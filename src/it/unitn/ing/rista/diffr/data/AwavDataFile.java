public class AwavDataFile extends it.unitn.ing.rista.diffr.DiffrDataFile {

  public AwavDataFile(XRDcat aobj, String alabel) {
    super(aobj, alabel);

    // user modification: put here the extension for the file format
    // you want to use. In this case this format is used when the
    // data file has the extension .dat

    identifier = ".awa";
  }

  public AwavDataFile() {

  }

/* This routine is called when the user load a file having the extension
   specified by the variable identifier.
   The method is responsible for loading the data from the file and put
   anything where it is needed.
   To load data you can use the following method:

      String astring = reader.readLine();
              this will read an entire line from the ASCII file and
              put all the line in the String variable "astring"
              Next time you call the reader.readLine() method it will
              read the next line in the file.

   Then you have to parse the data in the astring variable. To do that you
   can use the class StringTokenizer:

        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(astring, " ,\t\r\n");
              this create a StringTokenizer (a sort of object able to
              recognize the different entries or data using the specified
              type of data separator) that recognize as data separator
              a space (" "), a tab ("\t"), a carriage return ("\r") or
              a line feed ("\n").
   After creating a StringTokenizer for the astring variable you can
   call the nextToken() method to read from the StringTokenizer object
   the next String up to the next encounter of a separator. Example:

        String anotherstring = st.nextToken();
              this will read a partial string from the last reading point
              in the StringTokenizer object to the next separator encountered.
              The string is loaded in the variable anotherstring.

   There is another convenient method in StringTokenizer:
   hasMoreToken()
   it will return true if the StringTokenizer object has more data in it
   or false otherwise. Example of use:

              boolean moredata = st.hasMoreToken();

   The data you read using readLine() and nextToken() is in String format;
   if you need to transform it in integer, floating or double you can use the
   following methods:

         int i = Integer.valueOf(s).intValue();
              transform the string s in the integer i
         double d = Double.valueOf(s).doubleValue();
              transform the string s in the double d

   In this class you need to provide a value for the following variables (defined
   elsewhere); not all variable need really a value, only the ones labeled required:

   String title;                  required, the title of the data
   int datasetsNumber;                required, number of data
   double measurementstep;        measurement step (only if the step is constant)
   double startingvalue;          not required, starting value for 2Theta or d-spacing
   double radiation;              not required
   boolean constantstep;          boolean value equal to true if the measuring step is
                                  constant by default is true
   boolean dspacingbase;          boolean value equal to true if data is in d-spacing
                                  or false if in 2Theta; by default is false.

   What you need to do also is:

   init all the vectors that will contain the data, this can be done by calling
   initData(datasetsNumber);
   after you have specified the number of Data in the variable datasetsNumber and before to
   put the intensity values (and 2Theta or d-spacing values)

   put the intensity, 2Theta or d-spacing and statistical weight values using:

   setXData(i, x);       this put the 2Theta or d value "x" (a double) at the index "i"
                         (an integer)
   setYData(i, intensity);  this put the intensity "intensity" (a double) at the index "i"
                            (an integer)
   setWeight(i, wgt);      specify the statistical weight "wgt" (a double) for the data
                           at the index "i" (an integer).

   Just have a look on the following java code for the Venezia format example:
   the Venezia format consist of two different variants: one column of data or two columns

                               ------ one column -------
   title(first line)
   number_of_data scanning_step starting_2Theta radiation_wavelength(dummy) number_of_columns
   intensity(1)
   intensity(2)
   .....
   intensity(number_of_data)

                               ------ two column -------

   title
   number_of_data scanning_step(dummy) starting_2Theta(dummy) radiation_wavelength(dummy) 2
   2Theta(1) intensity(1)
   2Theta(2) intensity(2)
   .....
   2Theta(number_of_data) intensity(number_of_data)

   The datafile alzrc.dat is an example of the Venezia data format with one column
