- hkl labels
- window with coordinates always on top
- search box, fixed does not work
- +-2theta, texture not working for the minus
- more samples, phases with slightly different parameters?
- add excluded range plotting to multiplot
- add pole figure for arbitrary hkl
- 00l pole figures
- Pauley fitting
- interpolation and point selection/range
- add repulsion to restraints

- Superflip: storing the phase info, save FWHM, have a panel for text options
