<p>Any command transmitted to the server is put in a directory called 'Commands' in the root directory of the connected user. Fill in the command line field (main panel) by the requested command and press 'enter'. The server will send back a string like 'Command received: command_name" to confirm the command has been put in the correct directory.<br>
