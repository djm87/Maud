- Maud introduction - (to be completed)

The program was developed to analyse diffraction spectra and obtain crystal
structures, quantity and microstructure of phases along with the texture and
residual stresses. It applied the RITA/RISTA method as developed by Wenk,
Matthies & Lutterotti (1994) and Ferrari & Lutterotti (1994). The diffraction
spectra fitting is based on the so-called Rietveld method.
If you dont have experience on this method we suggest the user to read something
in the book: "The Rietveld method" edited by R. A. Young, Int. Union of Cryst.,
Oxford University Press, New York, 1993.

Be sure to read all the notes around waiting for a comprehensive manual to be 
finished. In particular read: all the notes in the online help from the menu, 
there are a couple of more specific helps in some windows (by pressing the help
button when visible) and in particular: 
- datafile format help in the datafiles tabPanel in the dataset edit frame
- analysis wizard help in the wizard frame
- anysotropic Popa model help in the corresponding option panel.
In the readme (also in this help menu) there are some additional tips and notes
after the installation notes. Reading the version notes can be helpfull to
understand what the program can do and how to do it.
In the Maud web page there are some tutorials for particular analyses. They
are the best way to understand how to perform and set an analysis with Maud.
Be sure to read them.
At the beginning, the program may seem to be confusing but when you get
accustomed to it you will find very fast in performing routinary work and
or trials, analysis with lot of parameters and/or phases, datafiles.
It works and was used for X-ray diffractometers (Bragg-Brentano, Debye-Sherrer,
film cameras, texture goniometers, position sensitive detectors like INEL 120),
neutron spectrometers (ILL-D1B, D20 or TOF) and even reflectivity measurements.
Instruments as well Phases can be saved in a database for subsequent retrievial
to speed up analysis preparation. The program may import crystal structures
from the ICSD database, by exporting CIF formatted structures from it.
Maud databases and analysis files are ASCII files in CIF format (enriched
by additional terms I never found in the CIF dictionary) and can be
edited manually.
