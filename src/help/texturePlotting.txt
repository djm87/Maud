-------------------Texture Plotting------------------------

This can be used only if you have at least one texture model specified associated
with one phase. It doesn't require any computation before. The pole figures
reconstructed are based on the actual available ODF.

To plot one or more pole figures (2D):

- select the sample to be used;
- select the phase for which you want to plot the pole figures;
- in the list of hkl's check or uncheck the buttons on the left to specify
  the pole figures you want;
- check that the 2D plot is active and the reconstructed pole figure intensity
  option also;
- press the plot button. A window will appear showing the minimum and maximum
  intensity values for all pole figures. Confirming will use that values for
  all pole figures. You can also specify your own minimum and maximum or
  press the button to have different scales for the different pole figures.
Additional option is for gray scale rendering, otherwise colors will be used
for intensity.

  
To plot one pole figure (3D):

- select the sample to be used;
- select the phase for which you want to plot the pole figures;
- in the list of hkl's select the pole figure to be plotted;
- check that the 3D plot is active and the reconstructed pole figure intensity
  option also;
- press the plot button. In the 3D window you can turn the pole figure by
  pressing and holding down the mouse button while moving the pointer.
Additional option is for gray scale rendering, otherwise colors will be used
for intensity.
  
To plot the pole figure coverage by the experimental data:

- select the sample;
- select the phase for which you want to check the coverage;
- select the particular hkl plane (it has no influence if every hkl has the same
  pole figure angles in one spectrum, e.g. TOF measurements);
- select the 2D plot;
- deselect the reconstructed pole figure intensity option;
- press the plot button.
Note: only enabled datafiles in active dataset for that sample are used.
To view the different coverage of the different datasets make them active or
not in the sample panel. In the future different markers or colors will be
used instead.

If you want to reduce the number of datafiles you can use the "Disable files wizard"
button after selecting the sample, phase and hkl plane. 
It permits to disable a certain number of datafiles to obtain a more 
uniform pole figure coverage (hexagonal etc.). This reduces the amount of data
used in the coomputation and speed up the analysis. To be used carefully. If 
necessary you can choose to simply disable these files or remove them completely 
from the analysis.
ATTENTION: the disabling is based on the hkl you choose. So if you have different
coverage for different hkl planes the result may be different for different planes.

Choose the "Close" button to close the window.
