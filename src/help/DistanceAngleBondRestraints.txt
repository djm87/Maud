------- Distance & Angles Restraints Help -----------

The object permit to add some penalty functions based on bond lengths and
angles.

The penalty function for each bond distance or angle is:

Energy = strength * (Optimal_distance - Actual_distance)^2

Energy = strength * (Optimal_angle - Actual_angle)^2

Advised values for strength are in the order of 100000. Change it
and use the "spectra computation" button to compute the energy
value. It should be a non trascurable fraction of the WSS to be
effective.

In the WSS this is used as: WSS(Energy) = Energy^2 * energy_weight^2

The energy_weight is the field near the "options" button that you press
when you open the options window for this object.

The angle is defined as the acute angle between A-B and A-C where A is
the pivot atom and B and C the other two atoms. Angles in degrees.
Distances are in angstroms.

If you change the number of atoms after this object is already activated,
you need to press the "Refresh atoms" button to update the list of
bonds. The list depends also on the max bond length as only bonds with
distances below this value are listed (also for angles). Use it to
decrease or increase the number of considered bonds.
If you press the "Refresh atoms" button and a distance has changed and
becomes greater than the maximum bond length, the restraint will disappear
from the list. Before pressing the "Refresh atoms" button, you may want
to save the modifications you made, otherwise you'll loose them.

In the tables you can change only the optimum distance and angle and
the strength value.
If the strength value is 0 the restraint is not used for that bond.
