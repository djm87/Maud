------------The Popa anisotropic size-strain model-----------------

The model implemented follows the theory reported by N. C. Popa
in J. Appl. Cryst. (1998), 31, 176-180.

All the parameters corresponds exactly to those reported in the
paper except that the crystallite value correspond to the diameter
of the crystallitem not to the radius and the microstrain is the
sqrt of the Ei parameters reported by Popa (the sign of the parameter
is conserved).

You can control the harmonic expansion (Lmax) using the slider. Only
even values are permitted.
You can press one of the plot buttons to watch the shape of the 
crystallite. The dimension is rescaled to the value of the first
parameters. Dragging the mouse in the plot window permits to
move the crystallite around its center. The crystallite starts having
the z axis pointing versus the upper part of the screen, the x axis
versus the right direction in the screen and the y axis normal entering
the screen.
A slider in the crystallite panel permits the resolution control. Be
aware that increasing the resolution will decrease the speed for 
rendering in the plot window.

To specify if a parameter is refinable or not, click using the right 
mouse button (hold down the control button and click on the Mac) in
one of the value fields (pink color) corresponding to the parameter
you want to change status (in a list with only one field select
before the parameter in the list).
