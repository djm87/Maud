<p>This is the first version of the ESQUI client help. Here you will find an index showing all the features implemented in this software and a link to a quick dictionary explaining the analyses you have met in the 'analysis' menu.
So far, we have only one section, dedicated to the commands the software can transfer to the server running where the diffractometer will be (Agrate, MI, Italy). The server will provide later the communication with the ESQUIGO local software to perform the right action.
Go and se the available commands. More will be implemented in the next future in tight collaboration with any good feedback...
